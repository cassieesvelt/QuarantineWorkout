# QuarantineWorkout
This project was the final project for my Computer Organization and Assembler Programming project. My partner and I created a console program using Assembly Language that creates a week long workout plan for someone stuck in quarantine. The program takes the user's preference for the intensity of the workout (easy, medium, hard) and what type of workout they would like (abs, legs, arms) and then gives them a workout schedule for it.
